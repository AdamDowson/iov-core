## Abstract

In the IOV ecosystem, many tools can be used with different blockchains.
Client-side, this is every application built on top of IOV-Core. Backend-side,
this is the Blockchain Name System (BNS), a lookup service which enables the
assignment of native blockchain addresses to human readable names.

All this tooling needs to be able to uniquely identify a blockchain, which is
what chain IDs do. The chain ID is interpreted client-side only and all client
software that wants to be compatible needs to agree on the same set of chain
IDs. The BNS just stores chain IDs without interpreting them.

## Format

A chain ID is a case-sensitive string in the format `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{4,32}$`.
When choosing a new chain ID, the following guildelines should be followed:

1. Choose a chain ID that is long enough to be unique within the blockchain
   ecosystem.
2. Choose a chain ID as short as possible to avoid unnecessary data.
3. Choose a chain ID that is to some degree human readable and helps for basic
   debugging.

Some bad chain IDs are `ethereum` (violates 1.),
`da3ed6a45429278bac2666961289ca17ad86595d33b31037615d4b8e8f158bba` (violates 2.
and 3.). Better alternatives are `ethereum-eip155-3` and `lisk-da3ed6a454`.

### Reserved

Chain IDs starting with `local-` are reserved for local chains. Please note the
trailing `-`, i.e. `localichain` could be registered at some point.

## Registry

The following chain IDs are registered. Please add new chain IDs via a pull
request.

## Background

- The term "chain ID" comes from the Tendermint genesis file entry and was
  adapted for our context.
