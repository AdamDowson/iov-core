# Ledger BNS

To run this code (or even `yarn test`), you must have the bns ledger app
installed and open and connected to the computer running tests.
The tests will prompt you to confirm transactions as well, so when the tests
freeze, go hit those buttons on the ledger.

## Compatibility

The code is compatible with https://github.com/iov-one/ledger-bns v0.1.0. 
In particular, it works with the app installed from `mvp1/samecrypto`. 
Please follow the README there and install properly before running this code.
And make sure the versions match.
