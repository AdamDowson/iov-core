# @iov/tendermint-types

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@iov/tendermint-types.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iov/tendermint-types)

@iov/tendermint-types is a set of types needed to define the @iov/tendermint-rpc, and likely many other
blockchain rpc adapters (so we may need to change it's name). It is relatively low-level, sticking with
the types on the wire, while [@iov/bcp-types](../iov-bcp-types) deals with higher-level constructs for the bcp api.
