# @iov/tendermint-rpc

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@iov/tendermint-rpc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iov/tendermint-rpc)

This package provides a type-safe wrapper around tendermint rpc. Notably, all binary data is passed
in and out as Uint8Array, and this module is reponsible for the hex/base64 encoding/decoding
depending on the field and version of tendermint. Also handles converting numbers to and from strings
for tendermint v0.22+.

In fact, the simplest possible user of the module is to assume it does everything
automatically, and call:

```ts
import { Client } from "@iov/tendermint-rpc";

const client = await Client.connect("wss://bov.yaknet.iov.one");

const genesis = await client.genesis();
const status = await client.status();
```

Please let us know if you need support for other versions of Tendermint or need
long term support for one specific Tendermint version.

## Code Overview

The main entry point is the [Client](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/classes/_client_.client.html).

The connection to the blockchain is defned by a flexible [RpcClient](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/interfaces/_rpcclients_rpcclient_.rpcclient.html)
interface, with implmentations for Http (POST) and Websockets. You can add your own connection type
or just wrap one with custom retry rules, error handling, etc. This client is just responsible for
sending JSON-RPC requests and returning the responses.

The actual domain knowledge is embeded in the [Adaptor](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/modules/_adaptor_.html),
which defines a class for encoding [Params](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/interfaces/_adaptor_.params.html)
and another for decoding [Responses](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/interfaces/_adaptor_.responses.html).
There is currently an [implementation for v0.25](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/modules/_v0_25_index_.html). This knowledge is mainly for those who
want to add support for new versions, which should be added to the
[auto-detect method](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-tendermint-rpc/classes/_client_.client.html#detectversion).
