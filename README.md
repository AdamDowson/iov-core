# web4

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/iov-one/web4.svg?token=evC2AgcwxuvHjXeBP3jq&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/iov-one/web4)

# Api Docs

Please run `yarn docs` (after installing yarn and running `yarn install`) in the top level directory
to generate local api docs. This will generate a `./docs` directory in each package that you
can browse locally to see API docs on the various packages.

TODO: we want to set up a build process and publish this somewhere,
but for now, you can run it locally (also good to see changes on dev branches)
